Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
     for the public:

Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International
Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be
interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 -- Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
   Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
   and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
   arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
   permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
   Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
   Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
   Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
   synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
   and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
   accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at
   creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative
   Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.

d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
   closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
   performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
   Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
   categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
   specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
   Rights.

e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
   absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
   fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
   Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
   agreements.

f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
   any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
   that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name
   of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this
   Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.

h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
   or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
   License.

i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
   terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
   all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
   Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
   under this Public License.

k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
   commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
   this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
   other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
   file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
   no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
   exchange.

l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
   process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
   as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
   dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
   available to the public including in ways that members of the
   public may access the material from a place and at a time
   individually chosen by them.

m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
   resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
   the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
   as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
   equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
   under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 -- Scope.

a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
               NonCommercial purposes only.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to permit You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

b. ShareAlike.

     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.

       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.

Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
   to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
   portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
   only;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
   contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
   Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
   including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
   all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
   EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
   AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
   ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
   IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
   ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
   KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
   ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
   TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
   COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
   USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
   DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
   IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
   possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
   waiver of all liability.

Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
   Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
   this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
   terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
   Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
   of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
   Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
   distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
   will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
   License.

Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
   terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
   Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
   independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 -- Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
   shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
   conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
   be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
   deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
   cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
   without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
   conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
   failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
   Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
   as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
   that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
   processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
